It's Christmas time, and there's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time, we let in light and banish shade
And in our world of plenty, we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time
But say a prayer and pray for the other ones
At Christmas time, it's hard but while you're having fun
There's a world outside your window, and it's a world of dread and fear
Where a kiss of love can kill you, and there's death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight we're reaching out and touching you
Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa
A song of hope where there's no hope tonight, ooh
Why is coming first deadly feared?
Why is to touch to be scared?
How can they know it's Christmas time at all?
Here's to you
Raise a glass to everyone
Here's to them
And all their years to come
Can they know it's Christmas time at all?
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world
