It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's time for play it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year around

Those marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the ever-green-trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin had
It's shining so your nose won't freeze

Oh the world is your snowball see how it grows
That's how it goes whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get up and roll it along

Oh it's a yum yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date what a spring is late
In winter it's a marshmallow world

(It's a marshmallow world in the winter)
When the snow comes to cover the ground)
It's time for play it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year around

(Those marshmallow clouds being friendly)
In the arms of the ever-green-trees)
And the sun is red like a pumpkin had
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
Oh the world is your snowball see how it grows..
It's a yum yummy world in the winter...
