Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold
Ding dong ding dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From everywhere
Filling the air
Gayly they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry merry merry
Merry christmas
Merry merry merry
Merry christmas
On and on they sin
On without end
Their joyful tone
To every home
Ding dong ding dong
Ding dong ding dong
Ding dong ding dong
Ding dong
Ding dong
Ding dong
Ding dong
