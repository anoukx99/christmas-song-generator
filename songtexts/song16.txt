Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack, you'll take the lead
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, oh, all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
I'm just crazy about horses
