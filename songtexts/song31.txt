Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling you
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling you
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy yap, giddy yap
Giddy yap, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap
Giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along to a song
Of a wintry fairy land
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy yap, giddy yap
Giddy yap, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap
Giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along to the song
Of a wintry fairy land
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling you
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Oh, yeah, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
