She was his girl, he was her boyfriend
She be his wife, make him her husband
A surprise on the way, any day, any day
One healthy little giggling dribbling baby boy
The wise men came three made their way
To shower him with love
While He lay in the hay
Shower Him with love love love
Love love love
Love love is all around
Not very much of His childhood was known
Kept His mother Mary worried always out on His own
He met another Mary for a reasonable fee,
Less than reputable as known to be
His heart was full of love love love
Love love love
Love love is all around
When jesus christ was nailed to the his tree
Said "oh, daddy-o I can see how it all soon will be
I came to shed a little light on this darkening scene
Instead I fear I've spilled the blood of my children all around"
The blood of our children all around
The blood of our children all around
So I'm told, so the story goes
The people He knew were
Less than golden hearted
Gamblers and robbers
Drinkers and jokers, but all soul searchers
Just like you and me
Like you and me
Rumors insisited He soon would be
For His deviations taken into custody
By the authorities less informed than He
Drinkers and jokers, all soul searchers
Searching for love love love
Love love love
Love love is all around
Preparations were made
For His celebration day
He said "eat this bread and think of it as Me
Drink this wine and dream it will be
The blood of our children all around
The blood of our children all around"
The blood of our children all around
Father up above, why in all this anger
Do you fill us up with love love love
Love love love
Love love is all around
And Father up above, why in all this hatred
Do you fill us up with love love love
Love love love
Love love
Is all around
