Angels we have heard on high
Singing sweetly through the night
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their brave delight
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why these songs of happy cheer?
What great brightness did you see?
What glad tiding did you hear?
Gloria in Excelsis Deo
Gloria in Excelsis Deo
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him Whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King
Gloria in Excelsis Deo
Gloria in Excelsis Deo
See Him in a manger laid
Who the angels praise above
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While we raise our hearts in love
Gloria in Excelsis Deo
Gloria in Excelsis Deo
In Excelsis Deo
In Excelsis Deo
In Excelsis Deo
