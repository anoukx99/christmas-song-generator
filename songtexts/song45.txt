I really can't stay, baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away, baby it's cold outside
This evening has been, been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice, I'll hold your hands, they're cold as ice
My mother will start to worry, beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor, listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry, beautiful, please don't hurry
Well maybe just one drink more, put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think, baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink, no cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir, mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried, what's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay, baby don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside
I simply must go, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, ooh baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been, I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm, look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious, gosh, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, gosh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more, never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home, oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat, it's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand, I feel when you touch my hand
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow, making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay, get over that old out
Baby it's cold outside
