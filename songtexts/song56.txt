I saw momma kissin Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
Well she did not see me creep
Down the floor to take a peek
She thought that i was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Well dont you know that
I saw momma tickle ol' santa claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
And what a laugh it would have been
If daddy would have walked right in
And saw momma kissin santa claus last night
I saw momma kissin Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She did not see me creep
Down the stairs to take a peek
Well she thought that i was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Well dont you know that
I saw momma tickle ol' santa claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
And what a laugh it would have been
If daddy would have just walked right in
And saw momma kissin santa claus last night
