The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
The party's on
The feelin's here
That only comes
This time of year
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding ooo
Ooo ooo toot toot toot toot toot toot
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ah don't look down
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, dong, dong, dong, dong
The party's on
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
Oh and that's enough
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Oh oh
