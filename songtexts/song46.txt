God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ our Saviour was born upon this day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy
From God our heavenly Father this blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy
O, star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding, guide us to thy perfect light
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain, gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never, over us all to reign
O, star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding, guide us to thy perfect light
Glorious now, behold Him arise
King and God and sacrifice
Hallelujah! Hallelujah, worshipping God most high
O, star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
