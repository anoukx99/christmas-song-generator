So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
Near and the dear one
The old and the young
A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
So this is Christmas (war is over)
For weak and for strong (if you want it)
For rich and the poor ones (war is over)
The road is so long (now)
And so happy Christmas (war is over)
For black and for white (if you want it)
For yellow and red one (war is over)
Let's stop all the fight (now)
A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
And so this is Christmas (war is over)
And what have we done (if you want it)
Another year over (war is over)
A new one just begun
And so happy Christmas
We hope you have fun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young
A very Merry Christmas (very Merry Christmas)
And a happy New Year (all around the world)
Let's hope it's a good one (hey, hey)
Without any fear (oh)
War is over, if you want it (the war is over)
War is over now (oh, yeah)
War is over, if you want it (yeah, celebrate)
War is over now (celebrate, whoa, yeah)
War is over, if you want it (oh, if you want it, if you want it)
War is over now
And so this is Christmas
And what have you done
