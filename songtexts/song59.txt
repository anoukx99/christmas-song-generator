What child is this,
Who, laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthem sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?

This, this is Christ the King,

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
This, this is Christ the King,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate

Where ox and lamb are feeding?
Good Christian, fear for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.




This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

This, this is Christ the King
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,

Come, peasant, kin to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

This, this is Christ the King
The Babe, the Son of Mary.
