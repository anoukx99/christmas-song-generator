# Christmas song generator

For the course Natural Language Processing, we got the assignment to make a code which generates text. 
As fans of Christmas and Christmas Songs, we decided to make a Christmas Song Generator!

The code takes 100 christmas songs and analyzes them.
It is possible to tweak certain parameters to change the results; for example the N-grams or the number of nodes in the LSTM. 
The results of the Christmas Song Generator is in the folder; "Generatred songs".
